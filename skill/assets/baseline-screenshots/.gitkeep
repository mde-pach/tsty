# Baseline Screenshots

This directory stores reference screenshots for visual regression testing.

When a page's visual layout is approved, save its screenshot here as a baseline:

```bash
cp ./screenshots/dashboard.png ./baseline-screenshots/dashboard-baseline.png
```

Future tests can compare new screenshots against these baselines to detect unintended visual regressions.
